logic works after majority of it moved to controller.
-break down custom_items_only in Order into 2 methods plus possible helpers to be used in each
-implement new current_user
-look for other frequently used logic like .find's, if ____'s etc.
        - think about putting these inside methods of their own
            -*** ideally they can use yield as well.
